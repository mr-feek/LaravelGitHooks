This package provides a way to add custom git hooks to your laravel project. Easily configure any artisan command to be fired throughout the git-hook process. Want to ensure that all tests pass before a bad commit is pushed? Now's your chance!
 
Currently, the following git hooks are supported:
- pre-commit
- prepare-commit-msg
- pre-push
- post-checkout

## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require mr-feek/laravel-git-hooks --dev
```

Edit your laravel project's `composer.json` so that these hooks are installed for every developer after they use composer.
```
"post-autoload-dump": [
    ...
    "@php artisan hooks:install"
]
```

## Configuration
- Publish this package's configuration file: `php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Feek\LaravelGitHooks\LaravelGitHooksServiceProvider"`
- Register specific artisan commands to be run in the configuration array. For example, all commands nested within the `pre-commit` array key will be run prior to a git commit. All commands nested within the `pre-push` array key will be run prior to a git push. If any of these registered commands fail, then the git action will be prevented.

```php
<?php
return [
    'pre-commit' => [
        'hooks:phpcs --diff --proxiedArguments="-p -n --standard=PSR2"',
        'hooks:eslint --diff --proxiedArguments="--fix --quiet"',
    ],
    'pre-push' => [
        'hooks:phpunit'
    ],
    'post-checkout' => [
        'hooks:install-deps'
    ],
    'prepare-commit-msg' => [
        //
    ],
];
```

## Commands
This package ships with several handy artisan commands which work nicely as git hooks. The following commands come included:
- phpunit
- phpcs
- phpcbf
- install dependencies (composer, yarn, npm)
- eslint

### Sniffer Commands
The `PHPCS`, `PHPCBF`, and `ESLINT` commands all allow you to pass arguments to the underlying process being executed. You
can utilize this via the `--proxiedArguments` flag. In the code examples above, the following phpcs command will be executed: 
`phpcs -p -n --standard=PSR2`
